/**
 * Executes Target Algorithm Runs (Converts between RunConfig objects to AlgorithmRun objects)
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation Details</b>
 * <p>
 * Clients should subtype this interface if they want to allow programs to execute algorithms through
 * some other method. All implementations MUST have a constructor that takes a {@link ca.ubc.cs.beta.aeatk.execconfig.AlgorithmExecutionConfig} object.
 * <p>
 * Additionally client implementations should probably not validate the output of AlgorithmRuns but rely on other decorators to do this for them.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b>Implementations MUST be thread safe, and ideally concurrent calls to evaluateRun() should all be serialized in such a way 
 * that honours the concurrency requirements of the evaluator (in other words, if concurrency is limited to N processors, then 
 * regardless of how many times evaluateRun is called concurrently only N actual runs of the target algorithm should be running at any given time)
 * <p>
