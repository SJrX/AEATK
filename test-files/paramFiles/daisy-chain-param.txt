#Daisy Chain Param
# i.e. each depends on the previous
#Params are numbered from 1 so that JUNit tests are easier (as we map to there position (in matlab format))
a { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 } [1]
b { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 } [1]
c { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 } [1] 
e { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 } [1] #Out of order to make sure we can declare them out of order for conditionals
d { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 } [1]

Conditionals:

e | d in { 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6}
d | c in { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 }
c | b in { 1, 2 } 
b | a in { 2 }


#e should be active if a=2, b =1, c =1 d = 2
